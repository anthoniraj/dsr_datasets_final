Hello Sandeep Kaki,
In this modern era, we encourage women empowerment in every way possible.

Yo Sandeep, It's Hamza
Can we be honest?
I have a pretty good body...	
But why did it take me so long to build this amount of muscle mass?
I could have had this body 4-5 years into training...
And yet it took me almost 7 years.
Although I'm very grateful to have built my dream body, I want to give you some mentorship so you don't make the same 2 mistakes that I made...
Mistake #1 - I didn't get consistent in working out till 1.5 years in!!
For the first year or so of my training I was inconsistent. I'd skip so many workouts.
I now know the exact science that practically forces you to build a habit.
Download your 900 word guide on Building a Habit of Working Out	
Mistake #2 - My diet...
I listened to the fitness YouTubers.
Please don't make the same mistake as me.
Listening to those idiots wasted years of my life and caused me to get a junk food addiction.
I won't waste your time. Here's the no bullsh*t advice to follow:
If it fits your macros is not an excuse to eat junk food.
The YouTubers make videos of them eating junk food because it gets views, not because it's the best way to build your aesthetic body
Eat clean. Eat a very, very small amount of junk food as a small treat everyday (nothing more than 100 calories)
Fill up on vegetables, healthy, unprocessed foods.
Lean bulk forever, only cut if you absolutely have to.
The most common diet mistake I see beginners make is cutting before they've even built a solid amount of muscle mass.
You do not deserve to be lean.
You can cut and still look weirdly skinny fat... 
Or you can lean bulk and actually build some size before cutting.
Check what time you got this email...
24 hours later from that time you'll get another email from Hamza and you're gonna get a guide on how to level up your willpower to stop indulging in cravings.
By following that guide you'll automatically stop cheating on your diet as much.
You'll get this in tomorrows email:

Hamza

Do you know what the 'halo effect' is?
It's the reason why we automatically like and trust certain people and also the reason why we automatically dislike someone...
Without even knowing them!
Attractive people have the halo effect.
Put it this way - The more attractive you are, the better people will treat you.
That's common knowledge for most people now.
But here's the awesome part for guys like us...
We're building our aesthetic body which is the best way to increase our attractiveness as men.
Women have makeup. We have muscle.
Some people think that it's shallow to improve your looks.
I think those people are silly.
If improving your looks is going to make your life better and also make you feel more confident with more self love, why wouldn't you make this a main goal of yours?
I take pride in my appearance. That's why I prioritise my body transformation.
How you can maximise your looks through building your body:
Just working out is not good enough.
You have to train the 6 aesthetic muscles to build a 'V taper' body.
The V taper in a man is kinda like the hourglass shape in a woman.
Women are automatically attracted to a man who has a V shaped upper body because it symbols upper body strength - the number 1 indicator of masculinity.
Men automatically respect other men who have a V shaped upper body.
Pretty much... Just lift weights (or do any kind of resistance training) and build your 6 aesthetic muscles.
B-b-b-b-but Hamza I'm brown/black/short/alien/green/whatever fucking excuse you want to use
No matter how shitty your genetics are, you can make progress.
I'll allow you to complain about your genetics, after you've built a 10/10 body. Until then, you have work to do.
Why not speed up your progress by learning from someone who's actually built that V taper upper body?
I've spent 7 years with the goal to build an aesthetic, V taper body. I've accomplished that goal.
Isn't it clear to you that I know what I'm talking about?
And guess what?
99% of the advice that I read online is total bullsh*t
A young man goes to Reddit, asking how he can workout to look good and the sweaty Redditors practically force the young man onto a strength based workout routine.
If you want a body like mine, you have to build your 6 aesthetic muscles. And they are:
Neck, upper traps, upper chest, lateral delts, lats and abs.
Now you can either continue mindlessly searching for nuggets of advice online...
Or you can learn directly from me - someone who's done the searching for you.
I've put all the important knowledge you need to know in my Aesthetic Body Course.
You can get the best parts of my Aesthetic Body Course separately.
That's an entire 33 page Aesthetic Training Program that comes with EVERY workout routine that you'll need for the first 2 years of your training.
You get some very, very nice bonuses too :)
Go here now to see the Training Program
Isn't it time you spent some money to speed up your body transformation?	
All the best,
Hamza

Hey Sandeep,
You won't believe the most common fitness question I get asked.
Hamza, what do I do if my back hurts?
Hamza, I've been skipping loads of workouts because my back hurts like crazy.
Have you ever been through this Sandeep?
When I started, this was me. I lifted heavy at times and then was on the bed for the entire week because of my back.
Let's cut to the chase, here's my advice to you Sandeep
 Practice the correct form. Now I know that this advice is cliched around the fitness community, but you've got to understand the balance between Lifting Heavy and Correct Form. If you lift heavy, you may not have the appropriate form. 
Choose your weight accordingly. Do not ego lift. Excessive ego lifting will only result in the gaze of the old hospital nurse.
Choose your chair wisely. Earlier I used a cheap chair and got a backache after 30 minutes of sitting. Recently I understood the importance of a good chair and invested in a good quality chair. It was by far one of the investments I ever got.
I've also linked a couple of Youtube videos that I recommend on the topic of Back Pai
Read More
I hope this email helps you Sandeep 
Do the hard work, especially when you don't feel like it.
Kind Regards,
Hamza
P.S What's the heaviest weight you've lifted? I'd love to know your PR's

Yo Sandeep, It's Hamza

Honestly?

I could have reached this physique at least 1-2 years faster...

I made some major mistakes that I hope that you'll learn from.

Maybe you'll build a better body than me in a shorter amount of time.

Building my body has been the best thing I've done.

Now I spend my time trying to get other young men to do the same thing!

You've seen my progress pictures, I've accomplished the full Simp to Pimp, Zero to Hero transformation.

And that's almost entirely because of my body!
I really want to help you with your goal.
It's odd how the human mind works.
You've been reading my emails and watching my videos.
You see my body transformation and trust what I say.
But you just feel hesitant to pull out your wallet and get something that would help you in your biggest goal.
This Aesthetic Body Course will help you more than other any random shit you spend your money on. Guaranteed. 
If you truly want to build your 10/10 body, it's worth investing into it.
I didn't invest. I did it all myself through trial and error.
Sure I saved some money, but that meant that I had a slower body transformation. 
Here you can skip the trial and error and just get the exact blueprint to building your body.
I promise you'll be very impressed with my products. I've put my all into this.
You can get my Aesthetic Body Course (that's literally worth over 1 grand) and guess how much I'll charge you?

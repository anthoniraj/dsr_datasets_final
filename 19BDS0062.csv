                       Celebrating 500 million installs!
For the Word of God is living and active,
sharper than any two-edged sword
HEBREWS 4:12
                           It started as a question.
What if people could have access to the Bible wherever they go?
In 2008, it turned into YouVersionone of the first 200 free apps on the App
Store.
What began as a desire to make Scripture accessible to everyone has now become a
global movement of people committed to seeking God every day through His Word.
Its a movement youre a part of
 A movement thats now been installed on half a billion devices.
A movement made possible because
                        Celebrate this historic moment.

                      Watch Video
                          Something BIG is happening.
God is actively at work through YouVersionand hundreds of millions of people
are a part of it.
Every time someone installs YouVersion, theyre getting instant access to a
Community centered around the Bible. A Community thats inviting God to shape
their lives through Scripture, Bible Plans, and Prayer.

Once I found [YouVersion], studied, read Plans, and connected with others, I
was hooked on the power of God flowing through the YouVersion Community.
Tony R.
                              God is not finished.
Today were celebrating 500 million installs  but were not just reflecting on
what God has done, were looking forward to what Hell do next.
Imagine a day in the near future when 1 billion people have installed
YouVersion.
You can help make this happen.
The best way to help us celebrate this historic moment is by sharing YouVersion
with someone in your life who hasnt been transformed by Gods Word yet.
There are millions of people still waiting to be transformed by the Bible, and
you are perfectly positioned to reach some of them. Allow God to actively work
through you by inviting others to discover that The Bible is Alive.

When you share YouVersion from inside the app,
youll earn the Share YouVersion Badge.

                 The Augmented Analytics Reset In Retail

Retail has undergone a tremendous amount of turmoil in recent years. The
Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the way consumers shop, with
current global supply chain issues only adding to the chaos. Online
retail has experienced a huge surge which has led to challenges around
coping with scaling to meet customer demand and issues such as needing to
process a vastly increased number of returns.

As they have become accustomed to doing, retailers have looked to
analytics to help understand the changes they are facing. But the lack of
relevant data due to the unprecedented circumstances means insights have
not always been easy to find. Traditional retail analytics involves
examining past behavior in order to infer future behavior  but existing
algorithms simply cant account for disruption and accelerated change at
the scale weve experienced.

View media in original article

To explore this topic in more detail, I spoke to Rich Clayton, vice
president for product strategy at Oracle Analytics, about the augmented
analytics reset thats underway across the retail industry. This means a
fundamental rethink of what retailers can achieve with analytics and,
crucially, how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to expand its
scope throughout all business processes at all levels.

In plain English, its about putting advanced technology like AI and
machine learning into the analytics workstream, he tells me.

""From how we connect to data to how we combine it with other data
sources, to how we consume and share it so that we can all do our jobs
better.""

One principle of this reset is that store operators can no longer
afford to be waiting for insights derived from analytics to
""trickle-down"" from centrally-located business intelligence or analytics
units. While we know theres a global shortage of data scientists, at the
same time, there has been an explosion in the availability of
applications, tools, and platforms that have the potential to put data in
the hands of everyone. This is where retailers should be looking for
strategies that will let them anticipate change and adapt accordingly.

Automated insights

As an example  a store manager, when they arrive at the store  their
cell phone can wake up and know theyre at the store. From there, it can
tell them what are the first three things they need to focus on right
away.

This could mean alerts that inventory issues are predicted, or that data
suggests a particular product is going to be popular that day. The
manager can then go about their day-to-day activities, such as inventory
management, merchandising, display coordination, or interacting with
supply chain partners, based on the insights theyve been given.

An analytic reset starts by reflecting on current processes, Clayton
says. This means examining the data platforms that are currently used
through the lens of the changed business priorities.

Once we reflect on our current state, we then begin to think about
restoring order and focus on our plans in the short term. What insights,
predictions, or analytic experiences do we need to focus on to meet the
new normal?

Only when thats fully understood should we start to think about how
these changes might affect our long-term strategy, Clayton suggests.

Sustainable and connected experiences

Navigating this reset should involve creating strategies to tackle three
challenges  creating connected customer experiences, improving the
integrity and efficiency of supply chains, and using data to build
sustainable profit models.

""Connected customer experience is probably the number one challenge today
because of how buying behavior is changing between online and offline,""
he tells me.

In fact, this aligns closely with the need to create sustainable profit
models, which, if they are managed properly, will emerge from the
connected experience. For example, retailers can look to correlate
customer activity across online and offline channels to build a more
complete picture of their behavior. Products and services can then be
offered with the aim of building and maintaining customer loyalty while
also generating profit.

Those are two things that are sometimes seen as being at odds with each
other, and I think that deeper insights through AI can help overcome some
of those challenges.

Managing returns in e-commerce is a great example of an area where new
thinking could have a dramatic impact. The dramatic upscaling in the
amount of online shopping being done by consumers  up to 10 years of
growth in 18 months, by some estimates  means retailers are dealing with
far larger quantities of returned goods, generating waste and expense.

Artificial intelligence can be used to predict where these returns are
most likely to occur  what items will most frequently be returned, by
which customers, in what regions. It can also help identify when returns
are potentially fraudulent.

If youre just going to accept everything thats returned, you're
probably going to lose money,"" says Clayton. ""But AI can predict which
items are most likely to be returned and make recommendations about what
can be done with some of those volatile items.""

Another area where analytics has been used to predict the effect of
dramatic societal changes has been anticipating where staff shortages
might be caused by older retail workers deciding to take early retirement
rather than return to the shop floor post-covid.

To get to the point where AI can help with decisions like these, many
retail organizations are going to need to overcome problems caused by
siloed data  data thats been collected and stored for a specific
purpose but not made available to the wider business, for use in
innovative ways. All this can be achieved by taking the holistic approach
to data strategy  where the value of data is considered across all
business functions  that Clayton is advocating as part of the ""reset.""

New ways of disseminating the insights gleaned from data need to be
developed too, and here natural language processing (NPL)  an Ai
technology that enables machines to express insights in natural, human
language, could be extremely valuable.

Store managers can't be expected to be data scientists  show them charts
and dashboards, and the insights might not be immediately obvious to
them. But the technology exists that can take data  whether it's sales
data, customer feedback data, or even social media chatter  and use it
to create narratives that can be communicated verbally  like a bespoke
podcast tailored specifically for the person its intended for. This
would make situations like the one mentioned at the start of this article
 where the store manager is automatically informed what their priorities
should be when they arrive at work in the morning  a real possibility.

Speed, scope, and scale are the keywords that retail data strategists
need to keep in mind when thinking about implementing these types of
changes or ""resets.""

There needs to be the capability to trial and launch data initiatives
quickly to keep up with the fast-paced change because insights that seem
critical today might not be relevant to the situation tomorrow. Scope
means always thinking about new data sources that can be included and new
channels that insights can be applied through. Scope means making sure
every aspect of operations and business processes is influenced by the
output of AI-augmented analytics.

Retailers have found themselves at the vanguard of an expedition into new
territory  simply because there is no rule book for managing the
widespread change in customer behavior that we see today. Those that are
willing to invest in innovation and the rollout of holistic, AI-driven
analytics strategies are best placed to achieve continued growth in these
fast-changing times.

                      The Future Of Delivery Robots

Delivery robots  just a few years ago, the stuff of pure science fiction
 are now very much a reality and quickly becoming a part of everyday
life for many of us. In fact, I will usually come across five or six when
I go for an evening jog in my hometown of Milton Keynes, England!

These particular ones belong to Starship, a company that deployed its
first autonomous delivery bots just three years ago and now operates a
fleet of over a thousand, in several locations in the UK, USA, and very
soon in mainland Europe too.

I spoke to their CEO, Alastair Westgarth, who told me that his robots had
traveled a total of 3.6 million kilometers to make 2 million deliveries.
Powered by machine learning algorithms, they are constantly getting
smarter, meaning they become more efficient as well as safer.

Of these journeys, the vast majority are completed fully autonomously;
however, human operators are always ready to step in when needed.
Westgarth told me, ""Safety is always our number one priority, so if a
robot encounters something unusual, it will stop and send an alert to our
remote operators.

""Most of the time, they will say it's okay, proceed  and release the
robot. That's 90% of the interactions  say there's a new crossing that's
highly complex. But 99% of the time, they are driving completely
autonomously.""

This increasingly confident performance is something I can vouch for
myself, having witnessed their evolution with my own eyes. When they
first appeared on the streets near my home, they would come to a halt any
time a person moved close to them. Now, it is evident that theyve
learned to navigate by themselves, and I will see them just make small
corrections to their course in order to avoid moving into my path.

The robots are packed with sensors, including cameras with machine
vision, radar, and ultrasonic sensors that detect solid objects like
curbs and walls. They cross 80,000 roads every day, and initially, these
were all carried out by human operators. However, as the robots learned
more about their environments, today almost every one is carried out
autonomously.

Weve driven 3.6 million kilometres so thats a significant amount of
ground weve covered, and we do it 24/7, in the dark, in the snow, in
heavy rain  when we first encountered snow it was something the robots
werent familiar with, it produced different images from the cameras, and
the sensors reacted differently, so we had to train our systems to deal
with that environment. They are constantly learning  our autonomy today
is orders of magnitude bigger.

When we talk about robots, one topic we cant afford to ignore is the
potential impact on human jobs. Delivery robots clearly pose a threat to
human employment, and while a common reaction to this is to suggest that
humans could be doing better things with their brains and bodies than the
relatively menial task of making deliveries, nevertheless these are jobs
that allow people to earn a living and support families.

Westgarth says that he is confident that enterprises like Starship will
make more job openings available to human beings than it will take away.

We believe in our heart of hearts that as we bring in more technology
that makes the experience more efficient and more valuable  that we add
to the employment base. We're migrating employment, and  at the end of
the day, we hope that the number of jobs we create offsets the number of
jobs that may be lost by autonomous delivery. If we look at history, as
efficiency and autonomy come in, the economy grows, and more jobs are
created - an obvious example is that there are no stagecoach drivers now,
but there are car drivers.

At the end of the day, there will be more people taking care of our
robots, more people providing services to the merchants we deliver for,
people programming our software, developing our apps on phones and
tablets. So employment will change, but we believe it will go up,""
Westgarth says.

Starships robots operate at what is known as the last mile of the
delivery process  in reality, the last one to three miles. This involves
delivering goods from supermarkets, grocery stores, takeaway food venues,
and restaurants. Other elements of the delivery and logistics industry
are concerned with longer distance domestic and international delivery,
and here the impact of automation will be felt soon too  with autonomous
shipping, delivery vans, and airborne drones all on the horizon. Of
course, I took the opportunity to ask Westgarth where he sees Starship
fitting into this and how society will adapt to the broader challenges of
autonomous delivery, going forward.

We have no intention of delivering Sprinter van levels  over ten or
twenty kilometers"", he tells me. ""There's a need for that and ways to
provide it, and today all of that is still manual. But probably, it will
become more autonomous in the future. [Delivery is] multi-modal  its
very difficult to scale these things economically with purely
human-driven options  so therere challenges there. [But] it's much
easier to scale the last-mile delivery, with an autonomous approach.

Were trying to deliver goods in as efficient and effective a manner 
where we're adding to the value chain instead of taking away. I think
it's a very bright future, we'll see autonomous vehicles delivering on
the road, we'll see more on the sidewalk, and we'll see other options
like drones as well. We want to be part of that future.""

full here, where we also cover issues including skills and qualities that
workers will need to thrive in an autonomous future.

                          YOU ARE WORTHY, O LORD.

Does the world feel heavy and dark right now? Do you wish you could see it all
made new? Make this your song today....

Do you feel the world is broken?
Do you feel the shadows deepen?
But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through?
Do you wish that you could see it all made new?
We do.

Is all creation groaning?
Is a new creation coming?
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst?
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this?
It is.

Is anyone worthy?
Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah, who conquered the grave.
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave.

Is He worthy?
Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
He is!

Does the Father truly love us?
Does the Spirit move among us?
And does Jesus, our Messiah hold forever those He loves?
Does our God intend to dwell again with us?
He does!

Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and
might and honor and glory and blessing. Revelation 5:12

Hi Shawn,
This time of year can be overwhelming. Let's get through it together. Here's how
we suggest you ace your midterms:
 1. Study With Video.
    Studies show you learn more with video. So how about 1.3M video solutions,
    matched to your textbooks, taught by educators who walk you through whatever
    you're stuck on?
 2. Use Artificial Intelligence.
    Our A.I. Tutor is available 24/7. Use it to build custom study plans, quiz
    yourself, track progress, build curated study playlists, and more.
 3. Ask Questions.
    Ask as many questions as you need and get custom video answers from our
    expert educator.
 4. Get a Study App.
    You can study with the Numerade iOS App anytime, anywhere, and even use it
    to solve problems by snapping a photo.
 5. Use Discord.
    Numerade Meet & Study is a Discord server with more than 30,000 members for
    when you need a study buddy, an answer to a question, or just someone to
    listen to music with while you work.
Ready to put these tips to the test? Get our midterm pack and let us help
today.

      The 8 Biggest Consumer And Customer Experience Trends In 2022

Our world is changing rapidly, and so too are consumer expectations.
Therefore, if your business wants to continue to add real value and solve
customers problems, you will have to rethink your products and services
to take account of the huge shifts taking place.

Broadly speaking, these shifts can be grouped into eight transformative
consumer trends.

View media in original article

Trend 1: Channel digitization and expansion

No doubt your business has already embraced digital routes to connect
with customers. Most have. But in the past, this digitization journey has
generally treated digital channels  websites, social media, etc.  as
add-ons. Now, the gear has shifted completely, and customers increasingly
come to a business via a digital channel. Digital comes first, in other
words.

One McKinsey global survey found that the COVID-19 crisis drastically
accelerated the digitization of customer and supply chain interactions by
three to four years  in the space of just a few months. This means
businesses must focus their efforts on building better digital-first
interactions with customers. For me, this means focusing on three
specific areas:

  * Apps
  * A smooth omnichannel experience (where customers can move seamlessly
    between different channels and still get a cohesive customer
    experience)
  * New, digital-only products

Trend 2: The cognification of products and services

Theres no escaping artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of
Things. Both are inextricably part of our everyday lives now, as
demonstrated by the increasing number of everyday products that are
labeled smart.

This cognifying of products  a phrase coined by Kevin Kelly, founding
executive editor of Wired magazine  is being applied to a wide range of
products, from fridges and cars to huge industrial machines in factories.
In fact, given the shrinking size and cost of sensors, pretty much
anything can be made smart. But its not just products that are becoming
more intelligent  services are also being beefed up with AI
capabilities.

Trend 3: Micro-moments and personalization

In this age of hyper individualization, people want to feel special. They
expect brands to understand and respond to their individual needs. They
want something thats unique to them, not the mass marketing strategies
of the past. To put it another way, your customers are craving a more
meaningful connection with your brand.

And they want it fast. Todays customers are time-poor and constantly
bombarded with content, so they expect quick solutions. The challenge
(and opportunity) for businesses is to pinpoint those exact moments when
customers are looking for a specific thing (be it a product, information,
or whatever) and then quickly give it to them. In fact, the window to
give customers what they're looking for maybe just a few seconds  and
this is what Google refers to as micro-moments.

Trend 4: Subscription and servitization

For me, this is one of the most important future trends. Driven by the
increasing cognification of products and services, organizations of all
kinds can now delight their customers with thoughtful subscription-based
services and products.

This trend is all about moving from a traditional business model, where
the customer buys a product or service as and when they need it, to one
where they sign up to receive that product or service on a regular basis.
The customer benefits from convenient auto-renewals and builds a deeper
connection with the brands they love. Meanwhile, the business generates
predictable revenue  because, so long as you continue to provide value
for the customer, they will continue to pay for it.

Trend 5: Cutting out the middleman

Also known as disintermediation, the direct-to-consumer trend essentially
means bypassing traditional intermediaries in the supply chain  such as
retailers, wholesalers, distributors, advertisers  to connect directly
with the end consumer. Brands across all sectors are now finding new,
direct routes to customers via online channels.

I believe all businesses must consider how they can build new ways to
connect directly with their customers. And for intermediary
organizations, such as banks and retailers, this trend obviously
represents a significant challenge. These intermediaries  who have been
quite powerful in the past  are being pushed out of the equation and
will have to rethink their businesses accordingly.

Trend 6: From B2C to all to all

The customer-to-customer (C2C) economy  where customers connect with
other customers to communicate or trade goods/services  has given rise
to massive platform businesses, like Uber, Facebook, and Etsy. There is
value in facilitating these interactions and transactions, and those
platforms that can create a safe, easy way for customers to connect have
seen enormous growth.

Even if your business isn't a platform business, it's worth paying
attention to this trend. There may be an opportunity to pivot to a
platform model or introduce a new business built around a value-adding
platform.

Trend 7: More immersive experiences

Thanks to extended reality (XR) technologies like virtual reality (VR)
and augmented reality (AR), brands can now impress their customers with
engaging, immersive experiences. (In fact, Ive written a whole book,
called Extended Reality in Practice, about the use of XR across a wide
range of industries.)

Todays consumers increasingly prioritize experiences over material goods
(particularly among millennials, where 75 percent say they value
experiences over things). And this means brands that want to stay
relevant must turn the customer journey  whether it is online or offline
 into a thoughtful, memorable experience. XR can help you do this.

Trend 8: Conscious consumption

Driven in part by movements such as the Extinction Rebellion and the work
of environmental activist Greta Thunberg, we've reached a tipping point
in environmental awareness. And with this growing awareness comes a
desire for more eco-friendly and sustainable products. Certainly, in my
family, we're regularly asking questions such as, ""Is this fair trade?""
and ""Was this farmed sustainably?"" We're trying to be conscious
consumers, in other words, seeking to understand the wider impact of our
purchases and, wherever possible, choosing more responsible alternatives.

According to this trend, were not alone. Take flygskam or flight
shame as an example. After the term was coined in Sweden in 2017, plane
ticket sales began to fall in 2018, and train ticket sales began to
climb. So, rather than gaining status for opting into conscious
consumerism, there is now shame around opting out of it. Thats a clear
sign that conscious consumption is going mainstream.

Reimagining your business to take account of these trends takes courage,
especially as it may involve cannibalizing your existing business model.
(Think of how Apples focus on iPhones and Apple Music essentially made
iPods obsolete.) And it requires humility, too  the humility to look at
other industries and organizations and identify what theyre doing
better.

No matter what you face, Gods goodness and mercy will never leave you. In fact,
He even prepares blessings for you in the middle of hard seasons. But these
truths arent always easy to remember, which is why giving thanks matters.
Gratitude helps us focus on the only One who is able to turn our problems around
for His glory and our good. So right now, lets take a minute to pause and thank
God for all Hes done in our lives.
                               A Prayer of Thanks
God, You are good, and Your steadfast love endures forever! Even in the hardest
seasons, I always have a reason to worship You.
Thank You for giving me victory and abundant life in Jesus Christ! Although I
dont deserve it, You shower me with unconditional love and forgiveness.
And so no matter what the future may hold, I will shout for joy because You are
with me. You comfort me and bless me in the presence of my enemies. Nothing
compares to You and no weapon can stand against You. In all things, I am more
than a conqueror through You!
Be glorified through me, God. Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of
my heart bless Your name.
I want my life to bring You praise.
In Jesus name, Amen.

The definition of a toxic comment on the Internet is subjective. Each individual
may have their own bar set differently. But which comment is truly worse? Can
you help determine the severity of a comment?

In this competition, Jigsaw returns to the discussions from Wikipedia Talk
pages. You will score a set of about fourteen thousand comments. Your scores
will be compared to human rankings performed on comment pairs. In this way, the
focus is on the severity of comment toxicity  from innocuous to outrageous,
where the middle matters as much as the extremes.

It's Frank Andrade from YouTube and Medium.

Data science is not all about model building. Tasks like collecting, cleaning,
and transforming data take around 80% of a data scientists time. That is a
lot of time! We cant omit such tasks because they are crucial in a data
science project, but we can automate some subtasks to save time and invest
this time in less monotonous activities.

I will show you 3 books that helped me automate data collection, speed up
cleaning and processing, learn some machine learning applications for
automation, and more!

  How Seacoast Bank Is Connecting With The Digital Customer Via Data &
                                Analytics

As life becomes increasingly digital, its vital that businesses adapt to
new trends in customer behavior and expectations. This changing behavior
brings great opportunity, as companies have many new ways to understand
consumers and adapt to their needs. However, it also brings new
challenges, particularly for small and midsize companies, as failing to
remain in line with their expectations will lead to poor customer
experience.

Some of the most exciting new tools that businesses are using to make
sure they get it right involve artificial intelligence (AI) 
specifically, machine learning. These are algorithms that become
increasingly accurate at making predictions as they are given more data.
When it comes to understanding customers in the digital age, this
technology is used by forward-thinking organizations to answer questions
like ""who are my most valuable customers?"", ""How do they want to engage
with us? and How do we ensure our products and services become their
go-to solutions for their own challenges and problems?

Other hugely transformative trends affecting the way that businesses
connect with customers today include the increasing demand for improved
experience and more personalized services, wide-scale adoption of
subscription services, and a growing tendency for customers to want to
engage directly with brands rather than go through ""middlemen."" There is
also undoubtedly an increasing interest in conscious consumption  a
desire to reward businesses that follow sustainable models and limit
their impact on the environment.

All of these seismic shifts in behavioral patterns are noticeable across
all industries, but financial services  with their focus on technology
and rapid pace of innovation  is somewhere they are particularly
apparent. Much has been written about the impact of disruptors in the
fintech space  small and agile startups who have been successful at
taking market share from well-established institutions, largely due to
strategies involving new, customer-facing technology solutions.

In many ways, this has led to established institutions playing catch-up.
To understand how companies, including SMBs, are facing up to these
challenges, I spoke to Robert Stillwell, analytics officer for Seacoast
Bank. Although Seacoast has a 95-year history and operates exclusively in
Florida, for the last three years, it has been listed among the Fortune
100 list of fastest-growing companies. Largely this is due to a renewed
focus on building connections with digital customers.

He told me, ""We are in this era of unprecedented technological change 
and what were seeing is customers are much more informed than ever
before, and they have much more choice than ever before.

To meet this challenge, his team at Seacoast built systems specifically
designed to provide what is termed the ""Single View of the Customer."" The
aim is to avoid the problems caused by siloed data  where previously,
many different departments from marketing to finance may have collected
and stored data in their own structures and formats, effectively making
it useless to those in other arms of the organization.

When we first started, one of the questions we had was how many
customers do we have? And we didnt even really know the answer to that
Stillwell admits.

With any business, once that data is consolidated into the single view
that Seacoast championed, it becomes far simpler to initiate processes
that hit the key trends consumers are buying into today  digitization,
personalization, direct engagement, subscription-based services, and so
on.

One successful initiative was aimed at raising awareness and encouraging
engagement with the facility to deposit cheques digitally. Customers who
were still visiting branches to physically deposit cheques over the
counter were targeted with direct communications promoting the digital
facilities.

A large proportion of customers were depositing cheques in our branches
 and of course thats a service we provide, Stillwell says.

But it felt like an opportunity  it's not really efficient for Seacoast
to be processing these cheques manually and  it's not convenient for
customers, theyve got to drive to a branch and get parked and wait in
line  when they could just do the deposit from their mobile phone at
home.

This one initiative had the effect of increasing customer engagement with
the digital service, while at the same time improving overall customer
experience and convenience.

My own experience working with small and medium-sized businesses tells me
that it isnt only large companies such as banks and financial
institutions that are tapping these trends to engage customers in new and
exciting ways.

Seacoast used the SAS Viya platform to develop its Single View approach
to data infrastructure, and the same platform has successfully been used
by companies ranging from sports teams to non-profits to improve overall
customer experience. You can read more about this and other customer
stories in this free eBook: Improving Customer Experience: How
organizations of all sizes are using analytics to gain customer insights,
make better decisions and grow their business.

Other companies are taking the approach pioneered by internet giants like
Amazon and Netflix to drive truly personalized experiences through
technology. Makeup manufacturer LOreal, for example, allows customers to
have their skin scanned in-store in order to have a personalized color
palette created for them. And Stitch Fix picks personalized selections of
clothing that are matched to individual customer preferences by AI
algorithms. This trend is defined by Gartner as a process that creates
an interaction between two parties that is individual and relevant to the
person.

Together, these trends offer smaller businesses some hugely exciting
opportunities around forging new or stronger connections with their
customers and fully realizing the engagement potential of digital
channels. Data and analytics make it possible to develop the type of
in-depth, 360-degree view needed to make truly personal connections with
customers. These are connections that will increasingly be seen as
valuable to consumers who have more choice than ever before, and who's
buying decisions are increasingly driven by the quality of experience.

Seacoast Bank, here.

importance of picking the right technology partner and the right way for

      The 5 Biggest Global Trends Every Business Must Be Ready For

No business operates in a vacuum. Todays organizations are continually
shaped by the world around them, and the same will be true for the
organizations of the future. It makes sense, then, that business leaders
must pay attention to emerging trends in politics, economics and society
if they want to build a robust, sustainable organization.

In this article, I explore the five biggest global trends  and how
businesses must prepare for them.

View media in original article

Trend 1: Our relationship with our planet

You only need to look at the abnormal weather patterns and natural
disasters were experiencing to know that our planet is under immense
strain. Couple that with a growing world population, and you have a
tinder box of uncertainties around crop production, food security, and
migration, to name just a few. By the end of this century, as many as
150200 million people could be forced to migrate from land that will be
underwater. And to keep pace with the growing global population,
estimates suggest well have to increase food production by between 26
percent and 68 percent by 2050. Thats a big increase for an already
struggling planet to accommodate.

I consider the emerging climate disaster to be the biggest challenge
humanity has ever faced. And this concern is widespread; according to
Ipsos, globally, 73 percent of people agree were on course for a climate
disaster.

So what has this got to do with your business? With a global majority
agreeing that the world is facing a huge crisis, we can expect consumers
to gravitate towards more sustainable options. And this means your
organization must do everything it can to maximize its green credentials.

Trend 2: Shifts in economic and political power

Solving the climate crisis requires countries to work together. So the
fact that global economic and political power structures are undergoing
huge changes makes this job all the more difficult.

What do I mean by changing power structures? In a nutshell, by 2050, the
list of the most economically and politically powerful countries in the
world will look very different to today.

Chinas economy, for example, is now predicted to overtake the United
States by 2028, five years earlier than previously thought. And the
combined economic power of the E7 economies  China, India, Brazil,
Mexico, Russia, Indonesia, and Turkey  could be double that of the G7 by
2040.

The takeaway here? As economic power shifts, it will become more
expensive for organizations to outsource services to countries such as
India. This is something businesses will have to plan for. On the plus
side, these economies could become strong markets for products and
services.

Trend 3: Growing divergence and polarization

There have been some notable examples of political fragmentation and
growing divergence in recent years. Brexit. President Trump withdrawing
the US from the Paris Agreement on climate mitigation. Russia announcing
it has the ability to completely unplug from the rest of the worlds
internet and operate its own independent internet In short, after
decades of countries growing closer together, there are signs that they
are beginning to ""consciously uncouple.""

When information and analytics company IHS Markit set out its prediction
of how the world would look in 2025, it said the fragmented world
scenario  in which the US, China, the EU, and other key global players
retreat from globalization and turn their gaze inwards  is the most
likely. COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate this further as countries are
forced to focus on domestic problems.

This growing divergence may mean companies find themselves locked out of
certain markets, which means relying on any one overseas market in our
increasingly changing world is a high-risk strategy.

Trend 4: Shifting demographics

The global population in 2050, or even 2030, will look very different
from how it looks today. Thats because the population is growing
(globally, that is  some countries are experiencing population decline).
Whats more, populations are getting older, the middle class is growing,
and people are increasingly living in urban areas. As an example, the
number of megacities (classified by the UN as cities with 10 million or
more inhabitants) is also on the rise; by 2030, there will be 43
megacities, up from 33 in 2018.

Clearly, the business opportunities around the growing urban populations
and consuming classes are huge. But participating in these markets
successfully will require businesses to adapt to different cultural and
political environments.

Trend 5: Social, cultural and workplace shifts

The workplace demographic is also shifting significantly. The number of
Gen Z-ers and millennials in the workplace is on the rise, and baby
boomers are retiring. And with this changing workforce come changing
expectations and priorities; as an example, 65 percent of people want to
work for an organization with a powerful social conscience.

How we work is changing, too. One in five global employees now work
remotely at least some of the time, and the coronavirus pandemic will
only accelerate this work from anywhere culture. Organizational
structures will become more fluid, and more people will expect to ""float""
between teams, roles, and employers. The days of the ""job for life"" are
well and truly gone, and more people will work in the gig economy, as
freelancers, and as free agents.

All employers must therefore assess their working practices to see
whether they are offering this changing workforce the working environment
they want (and expect)  one where people have greater flexibility, a
better work-life balance, and a meaningful connection with the brands
they work for.

These five global trends represent very real opportunities  and risks 
for businesses. Read more about these and other future trends in my new
book, Business Trends in Practice: The 25+ Trends That are Redefining
Organizations. Packed with real-world examples, it cuts through the hype
to present the key trends that will shape the businesses of the future.

Australia's stunningly beautiful Great Barrier Reef is the worlds largest coral
reef but it is under threat, in part because of the overpopulation of one
particular starfish  the coral-eating Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (or COTS for
short).

To scale up video-based surveying systems, Australias national science agency,
CSIRO has teamed up with Google to develop innovative machine learning
technology that can analyze large image datasets accurately, efficiently, and in
near real-time.

The goal of this competition is to accurately identify starfish in real-time by
building an object detection model trained on underwater videos of coral reefs.
  Total Prizes:

                                    $150,000

  Entry Deadline:

                                February 7, 2022
                             Join This Competition
Your work will help researchers identify species that are endangering
Australia's Great Barrier Reef & take well-informed action to protect the reef
for future generations.

Good luck,

Do you FEAR God?, and do you know why we should FEAR God?
Have you ever wondered why the Bible says we must fear God?
At the same time, we also read that God has not given us a spirit of fear.
All of this might be a bit confusing, and some might even think that the Bible
is contradicting itself, but the truth is that we need to understand what the
true meaning is behind these verses. Looking at the whole Bible in context, and
not only at specific verses.
 Psalm 33:8
""Let the whole earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand
in awe of Him! - (ESV)
What does it mean to stand in AWE of something?
The Cambridge Dictionary defines 'awe' as a feeling of great respect sometimes
mixed with fear and surprise.
We must have respect for God, and for the mercy He shows us every day. All of us
were created by God, He knew us even before we were born, and all of our days
has been written well in advance. He is the ultimate ALMIGHTY God of the
universe.
Is this not worthy of our respect and praise?
God is LOVE, and we must abide in love in order to abide in God. As a father
disciplines his children, so God also disciplines us, because He loves us.
(Hebrews 12:4-12)
 1 John 4:16-21 says:
""So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is
love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this
is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of
judgment, because as He is so also are we in this world. There is no fear in
love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and
whoever fears has not been perfected in love. We love because He first loved us.
If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who
does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
And this commandment we have from Him: whoever loves God must also love his
brother.""
It comes down to the love of the Father for us, His children. We as His children
must give God, the Father, the respect He deserves. Understanding that our time
on this temporary earth is limited, and one day we will have to stand before God
to receive His judgement over our lives.
This week I will be discussing the FEAR OF GOD in more detail, looking at the
Bible as reference, and delving into scripture to fully understand the meaning
behind this topic.

   DREAM
   TAKES OFF.

   We at SpiceJet, know what the power of a dream is. It can move mountains,
   tame storms, make you fly. We came across one such dream and we knew from
   the start that we had to be a part of it.

   This is Subhan's story  we discovered his story on social media through
   Humans of Bombay. Subhan lost his father at a tender age of 2. Things
   took a worse turn when Subhan had to drop out of school to support his
   family after his mother lost her job during the pandemic. He started
   selling tea to support his family and to continue his studies. But what
   saddened us the most is that he had to abandon his dream of becoming a
   pilot.

   Every dream has a day and this Children's Day we decided to give Subhan
   his most cherished gift. We got in touch with Subhan and flew down his
   mother and two sisters to Delhi. This was their first flight. But a
   bigger surprise waited for Subhan.

   Watch how this story unfolded and join us in wishing the best for Subhan.
   After all, if there is a dream then it should fly.
